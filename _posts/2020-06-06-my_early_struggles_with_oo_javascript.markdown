My Single-Page-Javascript-Application project is a team-builder tool for a mobile game called Marvel Strike Force. I approached this project with the full intent of writing Object Oriented Javascript code but that quickly fell by the way-side for me. I began to hammer features out and tackle problems one by one and this was a bit more "fly by the seat of my pants" programming that, for me, lent itself to functional programming. I kept on soldiering through until Friday at 10am I was finished and happy with the finished app. 

I had a personal goal that I wanted this project to be OO, both for learning/understanding and personal preference (I think it's often much cleaner). So I decided to dig in and start to refactor. I knew along the way that it would come down to this but I underestimated how long and complicated this process would be. I found myself rethinking my logic, and completely rewriting almost every line of code.

At the end of the day Friday, I had a nearly identical product. However I am much prouder of my code. I think it turned out much cleaner and am thrilled with the changes I made. I think using OO made my logic much clearer and my code less repetitive. It allowed clearer separation and organization. If I could go back in time and approach this project again I would take a little more time planning. I dove in quickly building upon function after function without taking the time to set up clear infrastructure and organization, and while the project might not have changed much it took a significant amount of additional work for myself to feel proud of it.
