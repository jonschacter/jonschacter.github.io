Flatiron School has been a great match for me and I have taken a lot out of the experience. The full-time program was a good combination of structure and flexibility. It gave me daily and weekly goals while still allowing me to balance life and sharing a work-from-home office in the midst of quarantine. The pace of a bootcamp can be very intimidating for some. There were times when I would start to feel like the information was coming on very quickly and as soon as I began to fully grasp something it was on to something new, but every time I looked back on my progress I would find the building blocks have piled on top of each other and I had a really well-rounded understanding of what I was doing. The projects and bigger labs were always really gratifying. It was a chance to put everything together, reflect on what you've learned and be creative. One of my only wishes was there was a few more of these touchstones along the way. I would enjoy weekly mini-projects that gave you a chance to test your understanding that was between the labs and portfolio projects in scope.

## Next Steps

As I complete the formal instruction of my journey it is time to look forward. I will be doing a lot of review of the material and some deeper dives along the way. I will be spending some more time polishing and adding some stretch features to my projects with my new knowledge and extra time. Then as I set foot into my career search I must continue my efforts to further my learning. One of the beautiful parts of this field is that it is always changing. New tools are coming out every day and I will do my best to continue building upon the foundations I've created. And lastly keep coding! I hope to make some more tools and apps to keep experimenting and practicing.
