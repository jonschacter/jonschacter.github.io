This project was difficult but really helped me grow as a programmer. I made a CLI that scrapes Ranker.com's list of "The Greatest Albums of All Time". Getting my program to scrape all the info I wanted was challenging and took a lot of trial and error but my biggest takeaway from this project was actually outside of coding. It was in file structure and project management. Everything up to this point has been presupplied by Learn with file structure and a test suite where you can do a minimal amount of coding to get everything working. This was a ground up project where I had to create the file structure, maintain a github repository and build everything from the ground up. I learned a lot while getting all the gem and file dependecies set up. 

Also it was my first experience outside of Test Driven Development. Instead of creating tests or relying on Learn's rspec files I would just write the code I wanted to end up with and building the functionality from there. Once I had the info scraping and storing properly, I designed my CLI with all of the commands and basic functions I could think of. Then I went back and started connecting them to the data, adding functionality and testing them. I am overall very proud off the product I ended up with and I feel like a more complete coder than I did last week.
