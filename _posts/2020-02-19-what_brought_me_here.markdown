My life has been an ongoing battle between my more dominant "left-brain" (associated with analytical and methodical thinking) and my desire to be creative or around creative people. In high school I excelled in math and science. I loved puzzles and problem solving but I'd spend most of my free time on music. I attended Berklee College of Music with the intention of being a trumpet player but was quickly drawn to audio engineering. Recording was able to fulfill both sides of me. It was a very technical field but also let me be surrounded with artists and work creatively. That took me to LA where I made a career of it for several years before deciding to try something different.

Programming satisfies these same desires for me. On the surface it is a technical, systematic puzzle to solve, while also having a lot of avenues to be creative with how you approach these problems. You can do almost anything through coding and there are many elegant (and not-so-elegant) ways to get there.

So far I've loved learning these new languages and concepts and can't wait to see where they take me next.
